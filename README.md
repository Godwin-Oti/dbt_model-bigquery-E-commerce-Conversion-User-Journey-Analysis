# üè† E-commerce Conversion & User Journey Analysis

This repository contains the **dbt (data build tool)** project for transforming raw **Google Analytics session data** into actionable business intelligence models‚Äîprimarily focused on measuring **conversion efficiency** and **customer value**.

---

## üß≠ 1. Executive Summary: Driving Business Insight

This project serves as the **backbone of our e-commerce performance reporting**.  
It leverages **dbt on BigQuery** to transform complex, nested user event data into a clean **star schema**.

**Core Goal:**  
Move beyond simple session counts to calculate critical KPIs‚Äîspecifically **Conversion Rate** and **Average Order Value (AOV)**‚Äîto uncover optimization opportunities across **device types** and **traffic sources**.

---

## üéØ 2. Business Objectives & Key Insights

Our analysis currently reveals a **performance disparity** between desktop and mobile users, highlighting the need for targeted mobile optimization.

| **Objective**             | **KPI / Metric**          | **Key Finding (from Mart)**                                                | **Actionable Recommendation**                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Revenue Analysis**      | Average Order Value (AOV) | **Desktop AOV ($221.47)** is **17√ó higher** than Mobile AOV ($12.64).      | Prioritize checkout flow stability and features for high-value desktop users. |
| **Optimization Priority** | Conversion Rate (%)       | Mobile conversion (0.30%) is nearly **10√ó lower** than Desktop (2.81%).    | Audit and optimize the **mobile site and checkout process** immediately.      |
| **Data Quality**          | Data Integrity            | Successfully unnested complex semi-structured data for reliable reporting. | Maintain strict data quality tests (see `tests/` folder).                     |

## üìä 3. E-commerce Conversion Summary Interpretation

Getting a clean final results table from your `mart_conversion_summary` model means your entire dbt pipeline‚Äîfrom unnesting raw data to calculating key metrics‚Äîis working perfectly. üöÄ  
This table provides **clear, actionable insights** into your e-commerce performance for the analyzed day.

The model groups performance by **`device_category`** and **`traffic_medium`**, allowing you to compare user segments across key metrics.

---

### 1. Revenue & Conversion Analysis (Desktop Dominance)

The most striking insight comes from **desktop users** with a traffic medium of **`(none)`** (likely direct traffic or an undefined source):

- **High Revenue:** This segment generated the majority of total revenue, totaling **\$8,858.76** from 1,424 sessions.
- **Strong Conversion:** The conversion rate is a healthy **2.81%**.
- **Massive AOV:** The Average Order Value is **\$221.47**, indicating that direct desktop visitors are extremely valuable.

| Segment              | Total Revenue | Conversion Rate | AOV          |
| :------------------- | :------------ | :-------------- | :----------- |
| **Desktop / (none)** | \$8,858.76    | 2.81%           | **\$221.47** |
| **Mobile / (none)**  | \$25.28       | 0.30%           | \$12.64      |

**Insight:**  
Our highest-value customers are arriving directly on **desktop** devices and are far more likely to complete large purchases.

---

### 2. Mobile Performance (Area for Improvement)

The **mobile** segment underperforms significantly:

- **Low Conversion:** Only **0.30%**, nearly 10√ó lower than desktop.
- **Low AOV:** **\$12.64**, suggesting smaller carts or lower-priced items.

**Actionable Insight:**  
There‚Äôs likely **friction in the mobile experience or checkout flow**. Immediate optimization of the **mobile UX and checkout funnel** could yield major gains in conversion and revenue.

---

### 3. Traffic Channel Performance (Data Gaps)

Other traffic mediums (`affiliate`, `cpm`, `organic`, `referral`) show **NULL or minimal revenue**, suggesting little to no successful conversions during this snapshot period.

- **Referral Traffic:** 261 sessions and a conversion rate of **0.38%**, but only **\$17.96** in total revenue ‚Äî indicating low-value or test transactions.

**Actionable Insight:**  
Run this analysis over a **longer time window (e.g., monthly)** to validate whether these channels are consistently underperforming or if this snapshot period is too limited.  
The current pattern indicates these channels may be **inefficient at driving high-value conversions**.

---

### üß† Conclusion

Our analysis highlights a classic e-commerce trend:  
**Desktop users are our core revenue drivers, while mobile users represent an untapped opportunity.**

**Strategic Focus:**  
Invest in improving the **mobile conversion funnel**‚Äîespecially checkout performance and user flow optimization‚Äîto close this performance gap and drive incremental revenue growth.
